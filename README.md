# Swisstronik Code Challenges 3

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat run scripts/mint.js --network swisstronik
```

Smart Contract: <code></code>
